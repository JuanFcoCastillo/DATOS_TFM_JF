# ABSTRACT
Biodiversity is suffering significant losses caused by human activity, which has consequences 
for ecosystems and their functioning. The interactions between species and the ecological 
networks that they make up are an inherent part of these ecosystems and their study can reveal 
important data for their conservation. In this project, we analyze the temporal dynamics that 
occur in a community of high mountain plants and pollinators through the study of different 
metrics at the network level (nestedness, evenness, complementary specialization and 
robustness to the loss of species), at the pollinator guild level (functional complementarity) and 
at the most common plants and pollinator species level (specialization, centrality and degree). 
Our results indicated significant variations in nestedness, degree of the pollinator species, and 
functional complementarity between pollinators between periods. Likewise, the latter varied 
significantly with the increase in plant species. Finally, our robustness measure showed 
significant variations within the same day. Such variations in the structure of our community 
can result in greater stability and greater resilience to environmental disturbances. We conclude 
by emphasizing the importance of studying the temporal dynamics that occur in ecosystems as an 
essential requirement to predict how these ecosystems will be affected by the current loss of 
biodiversity.
